/*
Consider the FSM described by the state diagram shown below:
https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/File:Exams_2013q2.png


This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, 
which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. 
Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal r[i] = 1, 
where r[i] is either r[1], r[2], or r[3]. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, 
and represents one of the three devices. 
The FSM stays in state A as long as there are no requests. 
When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides 
which device receives a grant to use the resource 
and changes to a state that sets that deviceâ€™s g[i] signal to 1. 
Each g[i] is an output from the FSM. 
There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, 
and device 3 has the lowest priority. 
Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is 
the only device making a request when the FSM is in state A. 
Once a device, i, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues 
to receive the grant as long as its request, r[i] = 1.

Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM. 
Use separate always blocks for the state table and the state flip-flops, as done in lectures. 
Describe the FSM outputs, g[i], using either continuous assignment statement(s) or an always block (at your discretion). 
Assign any state codes that you wish to use.
